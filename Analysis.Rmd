# Load package

```{r}
library(knitr)
library(dplyr)
```


# Load the Sequences.csv file

```{r}
SeqData <- read.csv("Sequences1.csv")
head(SeqData)
```

# Count the number of each base pair (A,T,C,G), in each of the three sequences. 

## Don't include any characters from the header, use the nucleotide sequence only; you MIGHT use `gsub()`, `nchar()`, for loops, if/then statements

The first couple of lines of code generate empty vectors for each count of nucleotide type counts. length = num_sequences to account for variuos numbers of sequences in a dataframe (i.e. makes the code more generalizable).

\n

The `for` loop is used to extract each sequence from the SeqData dataset and count the number of occurences of each nucleotide type. The loop iterates through each sequence.`gsub` removes every character in the sequence except the target. `nchar` sums the number of characters left. These number is stored in its respective vector of counts. 

```{r}
# Generate vectors for each nucleotide type count
num_sequences <- length(SeqData$Sequence)
ACount <- vector(mode = "numeric", length = num_sequences)
TCount <- vector(mode = "numeric", length = num_sequences)
CCount <- vector(mode = "numeric", length = num_sequences)
GCount <- vector(mode = "numeric", length = num_sequences)

for (i in 1:length(SeqData$Sequence)){ # For every sequence
  ACount[i] <- nchar(gsub("[^A]","",SeqData$Sequence[i])) 
  TCount[i] <- nchar(gsub("[^T]","",SeqData$Sequence[i]))
  CCount[i] <- nchar(gsub("[^C]","",SeqData$Sequence[i]))
  GCount[i] <- nchar(gsub("[^G]","",SeqData$Sequence[i]))
} # End of loop
```

# Print out each sequence

```{r}
print(SeqData$Sequence)
```

# Print out the number of each nucleotide as a table for each of the three sequences

The first line creates an empty vector that is the length of the number of sequences in the dataset. 

\n

A `for` loop is used to extract the Sequence ID from the name of each sequence in the dataset. Assumes the first character in the name is a `>` and the ID is 10 characters long. `substr()` function is used to do this extraction. I found this function [here](https://stat.ethz.ch/R-manual/R-devel/library/base/html/substr.html).

\n

The next line creates a dataframe which each vector of ID's and vectors of counts.

\n

`kable()` is used to make a pretty table

```{r}
Seq_ID <- vector(length = num_sequences)

for (i in 1:length(SeqData$Sequence)){ # For every sequence
  Seq_ID[i] <- substr(SeqData$Name[i], 2, 11) # Extract the ID 
} # End loop

BPCount <- data.frame(Seq_ID, ACount, TCount, CCount, GCount)
kable(BPCount, col.names = c("Sequence ID", "A Count", "T Count",
                             "C Count", "G Count"), align = "c")
```

# Calculate the GC Content (% of nucleotides that are G or C and create a final table showing GC content for each sequence ID.

`transmute()` is used to create a new column that is the % GC Content in each sequence. This function keeps the Seq_ID variable. `round()` is used in the function to limit the number of decimals to 2. 

```{r}
GC_Data <- transmute(BPCount,Seq_ID, 
                     GC_Content = round(((CCount + GCount)/
                       (ACount + TCount + CCount + GCount))*100, 
                       digits = 2))
kable(GC_Data, col.names = c("Sequence ID", "% GC Content"), align = "c")
```
